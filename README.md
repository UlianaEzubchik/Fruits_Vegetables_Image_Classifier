# Fruits and Vegetables Image Classifier
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of fruits and vegetables, featuring a Streamlit deployment app.

## Overview

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The repository includes the code for training the model and deploying it using Streamlit. The model is trained on a dataset of various fruits and vegetables and is capable of accurately predicting the class of the uploaded images.
